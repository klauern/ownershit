# Ownershit Repository Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines identified issues and improvement recommendations for the `ownershit` CLI tool - a Go application for managing GitHub repository ownership, permissions, and settings across organizations.

## Current State Analysis

**Project Overview**: CLI tool using GitHub REST v3 and GraphQL v4 APIs for repository management
**Test Coverage**: Main package 72.1%, CLI commands 0%, GraphQL API 13.9%
**Code Quality**: 15+ linting violations identified
**Architecture**: Well-structured with good separation of concerns

## Issues Identified

### 1. Code Quality Issues (High Priority)

**Linting Violations (15+ issues)**:
- Unchecked error returns in `cmd/genqlient/main.go:16,17`
- Integer overflow potential in `github_v4.go:73` (G115: int -> int32 conversion)
- Unused code in test files (`v4api/client_test.go`)
- Resource leak in defer loops (`v4api/client_test.go:59`)
- Dynamic error creation instead of wrapped static errors (multiple files)
- Deprecated linter configuration options

**Specific Files Requiring Attention**:
- `cmd/genqlient/main.go` - Missing error checks
- `github_v4.go:73` - Integer overflow risk
- `v4api/client_test.go` - Unused code and resource leaks
- `cmd/archiving.go` - Formatting issues

### 2. Test Coverage Issues (Medium Priority)

**Coverage Gaps**:
- CLI commands: 0% coverage (`cmd/` packages)
- GraphQL API: 13.9% coverage (`v4api/` package)
- Unused test utilities and mock functions

**Impact**: Reduced confidence in code changes and deployments

### 3. Security Considerations (Medium Priority)

**Token Management**:
- GitHub token exposure risk via environment variable
- No validation of token format or presence

**Security Tooling**:
- Missing vulnerability scanning (`govulncheck` not available)
- No automated security audit in CI/CD

### 4. Configuration and Maintenance (Low Priority)

**Configuration Issues**:
- Deprecated golangci-lint options
- Inconsistent code formatting
