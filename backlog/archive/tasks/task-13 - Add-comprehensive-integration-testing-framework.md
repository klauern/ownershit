## Description

Establish a robust integration testing framework to test real GitHub API interactions and end-to-end workflows safely

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Integration test framework established
- [x] Safe test repository setup working
- [x] End-to-end command workflow tests implemented
- [x] GitHub API integration tests functional
- [x] Test cleanup automation working

## Implementation Notes

Comprehensive integration testing framework has been implemented with E2E CLI tests (e2e_cli_test.go), GitHub API integration tests (branch_protection_integration_test.go, config_integration_test.go, v4api/client_integration_test.go), safe test configurations with environment-based controls (RUN_E2E_TESTS, E2E_ALLOW_MODIFICATIONS), mock-based testing with proper setup/cleanup, and dedicated test/e2e directory. Tests cover real GitHub API interactions, end-to-end command workflows, and include dry-run safety modes to prevent unintended modifications during testing.
