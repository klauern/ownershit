## Description

Enhance the import command to extract comprehensive repository configuration options including default_branch, visibility status (private/public), archived status, template status, and other repository metadata that are currently missing from the import output

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Import command extracts default_branch setting from repository configuration,Import command extracts repository visibility (private/public) status,Import command extracts archived repository status,Import command extracts template repository status,Import command extracts additional repository settings like description and homepage URL,Generated YAML includes comprehensive repository configuration in appropriate sections,Import handles edge cases like repositories with no default branch set
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current repository import functionality in import command
2. Identify GitHub API fields for default_branch, visibility, archived, template status
3. Update repository struct to include new fields
4. Modify import logic to extract additional settings
5. Update YAML generation to include new repository configuration
6. Test with various repository types (private/public, archived, template)
7. Handle edge cases like missing default branch

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented additional repository settings import functionality. Enhanced both Repository struct and repositoryDetails to include default_branch, private, archived, template, description, and homepage fields. Updated getRepositoryDetails function to extract these fields from GitHub API response. Added comprehensive unit tests and integration tests covering all scenarios including repositories with and without optional fields. All tests pass with increased test coverage. The import command now extracts comprehensive repository configuration including all requested metadata fields and generates YAML with proper serialization tags.
