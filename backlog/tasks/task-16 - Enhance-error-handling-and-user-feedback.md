## Implementation Notes

Comprehensive error handling has been implemented with a complete error taxonomy including GitHubAPIError, AuthenticationError, RateLimitError, RepositoryNotFoundError, PermissionDeniedError, ConfigValidationError, ConfigFileError, ArchiveEligibilityError, and NetworkError. All errors provide user-friendly messages with contextual information, structured debugging details, and clear error categorization. Error logging is implemented throughout the application with the zerolog library providing structured logging with operation context, repository information, and detailed error messages.
