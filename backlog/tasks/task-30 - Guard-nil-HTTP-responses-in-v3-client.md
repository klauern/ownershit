## Description

Prevent nil pointer dereference when resp is nil in AddPermissions/Edit/label paths; restrict response dumps to debug.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Guard resp before accessing fields
- [x] #2 Dump response only in debug
- [x] #3 Verify tests
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Add resp nil guards\n2. Guard dumps behind debug\n3. Run tests


## Implementation Notes

Wrapped HTTP response dumps in debug-only blocks and checked for nil; fixed unused variable by logging chain assignment removal where appropriate.
