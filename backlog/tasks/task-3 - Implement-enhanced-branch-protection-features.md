## id: task-3 title: Implement enhanced branch protection features status: Done assignee: [] created_date: '2025-07-10' updated_date: '2025-08-18 03:11' labels: [] dependencies: []

## Description

Add advanced branch protection capabilities including status checks, admin enforcement, push restrictions, and conversation resolution requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Status check requirements implemented
- [x] Conversation resolution requirements added
- [x] Admin enforcement bypass controls working
- [x] Push restrictions by user/team functional
- [x] Linear history enforcement active
- [x] Force push restrictions configured

## Implementation Notes

All enhanced branch protection features have been implemented and are available in the configuration schema. The BranchPermissions struct includes all required fields: RequireStatusChecks/StatusChecks for status check requirements, RequireConversationResolution for conversation resolution, EnforceAdmins for admin enforcement bypass, RestrictPushes/PushAllowlist for push restrictions, RequireLinearHistory for linear history enforcement, and AllowForcePushes for force push restrictions. All features are validated in ValidateBranchPermissions() and applied via SetEnhancedBranchProtection() and SetBranchProtectionFallback() methods.
